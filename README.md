</div>

- The colours were chosen to stand out yet at the time compliment each other, which is also one of the main beliefs of Picturesque.

### Styling
- The dark blue was used as the footer to help contrast with the light colours and make the items in the footer stand out.
- Blue was used for the main titles and purple for the sub headings. 
- Purple was used for main buttons and pink for secondary to give more importance to the main buttons. Both buttons have a pink hover colour change
- Curved buttons and pictures were mostly used to give a pleasing look to the eye.

### Testing

Picturesque testing: [Testing](https://github.com/anthonybguillermo/picturesque/blob/master/TESTING.md).

### Deployment

- Create a new app in Heroku
- Go to resources tab add Heroku Postgres 
-Install the following apps using pip3 install
```
dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary
```
- Go to project level settings in Github. Import
```
dj_database_url
```
- In databases comment out default configuration then set the Postgres database as default.
```
# DATABASES = {
# 'default': {
# 'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
# 'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
# }
# }

DATABASE = {
'default' = dj_database_url('<postgress config variable>')
}
```
- Connect to new Postgres data base and migrate the data along with any fixtures to populate the model.
- Create a super user to access the admin panel
- In settings.py set the Postgres database as default and if in development set to sqlite3
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
DATABASES = {
'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
else:
DATABASES = {
'default': {
'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
	}
}
```
-Install pip3 install gunicorn to act as a webserver. Add a procfile to create a web dyno.
```
web: gunicorn boutique_ado.wsgi:application
```
- Disable collect static in Heroku as the app doesn't load static files
```
herkoku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
```
- All host name to allowed host in settings.py and set debug to development
```
DEBUG = 'DEVELOPMENT' in os.environ
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['ckz8780-boutique-ado.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
-Push code to Github and then in Heroku settings set to connect Github. This is to make the deploys automatic. 
- Generate a random secret key and set SECRET_KEY in config vars. Then in setting.py remove the secret key and set it to look in the environment. Also set debug to be in development mode only.
```
SECRET_KEY  =  os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY', '')
DEBUG  =  'DEVELOPMENT'  in  os.environ
```
- Using AWB s3 create bucket for the static files and allow public access and set the region.
- In bucket settings under properties turn on static website hosting. Fill in default values for documents.
- In permissions tab paste in a cors configuration
```
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```
- Create an s3 bucker policy , allow all principles by using a * and service is get object. Copy and paste the ARN to add statement and generate a policy.
- Copy the policy and paste in the bucket policy editor. Add a /* after the bucket name to allow access to all resources in the bucket.
- Go to access control list under principals and enable public access.
- Create a user through IAM by first creating a group and creating a policy for the group, then create a user to add to the group to use the policy.
- User access and secret access key are generated and can be downloaded as a csv.
- In git hub pip3 install boto3 and django storages then freeze to requirements.txt
- Set up access to the bucket in settings.py and set USE_AWS to true in Heroku config vars.
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:

AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = '<bucket name>'
AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = '<region>'
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'
```

- Add the AWS access and secret access to the config vars in Heroku
- Create a file custom_storages to store images and static files. 
```
from django.conf import settings
from storages.backends.s3boto3 import S3Boto3Storage

class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```
- Set the location of the storages in settings.py and override static media files
```

STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'


STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
- Set the cache in settings.py to save the files
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```
- In s3 bucket create a media folder alongside the static folder and upload all images for the site. Then grant public access to files.
- For Stripe to work in Heroku config vars save the STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and paste the keys from Stripe.
- Set up web hooks by adding the Heroku <heroku app url/checkout/wh> for the app to web hooks endpoint to receive all events.
- Get web hooks signing secret and add to Heroku config vars under STRIP_WH_SECRET.
