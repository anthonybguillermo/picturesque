</div>

- The colours were chosen to stand out yet at the time compliment each other, which is also one of the main beliefs of Picturesque.

### Styling
- The dark blue was used as the footer to help contrast with the light colours and make the items in the footer stand out.
- Blue was used for the main titles and purple for the sub headings. 
- Purple was used for main buttons and pink for secondary to give more importance to the main buttons. Both buttons have a pink hover colour change
- Curved buttons and pictures were mostly used to give a pleasing look to the eye.
